            <h2>RADIATION <i class="fa-solid fa-radiation"></i></h2>
            <p class="text-left">Harmful radiation permeates the cosmos. Our sun and other stars are essentially fusion
                reactors that spew
                abundant amounts of electromagnetic energy, including X-ray and ultraviolet radiation.<br><br> The sun,
                as well
                as other intensively energetic objects like quasars or the center of galaxies,<br> also emit high-energy
                protons, atomic nuclei and other particles that can cause radiation sickness,<br> adversely affect a
                person’s central nervous system,<br> increase one’s lifetime risk for cancer and cause degenerative
                diseases.</p>

            <h2>ATMOSPHERE <i class="fa-solid fa-wind"></i></h2>
            <p class="text-left">One of the most important attributes a planet needs to support human life is an
                atmosphere.<br><br>
                Unfortunately, a very thin one clings to Mars and it’s made up of all the wrong gases.</p>

        <div id="water">
            <h2>WATER <i class="fa-solid fa-water"></i></h2>
            <p class="text-left">Water is essential to human life on Mars, but the Red Planet doesn’t contain water — or
                does it? Evidence
                dating back to the 1970s says otherwise.<br><br> When the Mariner 9 and Viking space probes first sent
                images of
                Mars back to Earth, there were signs of water.</p>

                <h3>Why Mars?</h3>
                <p class="text-left">At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one of Earth's closest
                    habitable neighbors. Mars
                    is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight.<br><br> It is
                    a little
                    cold, but we can warm it up. Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few
                    other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the
                    atmosphere.<br><br> Gravity on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift
                    heavy things
                    and bound around. Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth.</p>

            <div class="when-why-data">
                <h3>When?</h3>
                <p class="text-left">The CEO and founder of SpaceX is working for his Starship spacecraft to reach the
                    red planet.<br><br> As his
                    plans even aim to establish a city on Mars and in his first statements in this regard,<br> said in
                    December 2020.<br><br> He calculated that this milestone would be achieved between 2024 and 2026.
